## News Recommender System
The capstone project for the NLP track of the Post Graduate Diploma in Data Science from UpGrad.

The idea is to recommend news articles to users based on an NLP algorithm. Whether it is content-based or collaborative depends on the performance of the models themselves.

A website that uses this algorithm and shoes the results in a UI is in development.
